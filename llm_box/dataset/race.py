    The ReAding Comprehension dataset from Examinations (RACE) dataset is a machine reading comprehension dataset
    consisting of 27,933 passages and 97,867 questions from English exams, targeting Chinese students aged 12-18.
    RACE consists of two subsets, RACE-M and RACE-H, from middle school and high school exams, respectively.
    RACE-M has 28,293 questions and RACE-H has 69,574.
    Each question is associated with 4 candidate answers, one of which is correct.

    Example:
        article:
        The rain had continued for a week and the flood had created a big river which were ... with tears.

        question: What did Nancy try to do before she fell over?
