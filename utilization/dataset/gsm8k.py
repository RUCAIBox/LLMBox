1. Since Rena will be 5 years older than Pam in 10 years, she must be 5 years older than Pam now as well.
2. If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena, that means that Rena is currently twice as old as Pam is. So if P stands for Pam's age now and R stands for Rena's age now, then we know that R = 2 * P And since Rena is 5 years older than Pam now, we know that R = P + 5.
